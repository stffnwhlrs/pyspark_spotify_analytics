# Helping Warner Music increasing its market share
With
the help of PySpark and the Spotify dataset from
Kaggle I created a data analysis. My fictional client is Warner
Music Group who wants to increase its market share.
I found out that the signing of two upcoming reggaeton
singers, focusing on the genre “chill” and the creation of
energetic sung songs could help Warner Music group to
increase its market share.

Please check the PDF file `spark_individual_assignment_steffen_wohlers.pdf` for further information.

I created this project as part of my Spark course during my Master in Business Analytics & Big Data program at IE Business School.
